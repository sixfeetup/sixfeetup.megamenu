Code blatantly copied from webcouturier.dropdownmenu, then modified to
display as a megamenu that fills the site width. Made for Plone 5.

For examples, see:

TODO:

Would be good if some of the values were set from a control panel:

* max site width (but really this should fill the content area automatically )
* width for displaying mobile nav (or fill content area)
* timeout for displaying menu
* timeout for hiding menu
* number of links per column
